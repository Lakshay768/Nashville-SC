Data Project
For the project, you will be assuming the role of GM for an expansion franchise in MLS. You have almost completed your roster, but you still need a striker, central midfielder, and a right back. Due to the restrictive roster regulations in MLS, your selected players must meet certain criteria:

 

One of the players must fill a reserve roster spot â€“ to meet this criteria, select a USL player under the age of 24 in the 2020 season to fill at least one of the positions
Two of the players must be domestic under the guidelines described by MLS
The total salary of any MLS player(s) must be $400,000 or less (based on 2019 guaranteed compensation)
 

We would like you to provide us with:

1 data visualization to support your findings (preferably created in R)
Any code utilized in making the decision (can provide GitHub link if applicable)
A writing sample (1000 words or less) detailing:
Your selections
The process you used to make those selections
Information that was not made available to you that could have changed your perspective.
Data folder contains the datasets provided for this project.
